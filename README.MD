# Project Title

PROPERTY FINDER TRIP SORTER

This projects intends to sort a list of boarding cards given in an itinerary. 
It assumes that the input list of $boardingCards is not cyclic and there 
is one ticket from every BoardingCard city except final destination.
e.g ["Mombasa":"Nairobi","Nairobi":"Kisumu","Kisumu":"Kampala"]
It uses hashing technique to avoid building a graph
All steps require O(n) time so overall time complexity is O(n).
